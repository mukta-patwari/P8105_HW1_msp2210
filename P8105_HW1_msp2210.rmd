```

## Problem 1

**Loading libraries**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
```

**Loading the dataset**

```{r}
data("early_january_weather")
```

This dataset has `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns. This dataset has 15 variables, which are `r names(early_january_weather)`. The mean temperature is `r mean(pull(early_january_weather, temp))` degrees Fahrenheit. The highest temperature recorded was `r max(pull(early_january_weather, temp))` degrees Fahrenheit and the lowest temperature recorded was `r min(pull(early_january_weather, temp))` degrees Fahrenheit.
