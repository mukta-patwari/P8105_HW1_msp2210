## Problem 1

**Loading libraries**

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──
    ## ✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5
    ## ✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.2
    ## ✔ ggplot2   4.0.0     ✔ tibble    3.3.0
    ## ✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1
    ## ✔ purrr     1.1.0     
    ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
    ## ℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors

``` r
library(moderndive)
```

**Loading the dataset**

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

This dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns. This dataset has 15 variables,
which are origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir,
wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour. The mean
temperature is 39.5821229 degrees Fahrenheit. The highest temperature
recorded was 57.92 degrees Fahrenheit and the lowest temperature
recorded was 24.08 degrees Fahrenheit.

**Creating a scatterplot**

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color=humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](P8105_HW1_msp2210_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

Based on this plot, it is clear how temperature fluctuates throughout
the day. There is a zig-zag effect, because higher temperatures are
occurring during the day and then they decline at night (and this is a
cycle that continues throughout the month). The beginning of the month
has cooler temperatures during daytime and nighttime, and by January
14th, both of these temperatures have increased. Also, there was less
humidity at the beginning of the month when compared to the days leading
up to January 14th.

**Saving scatterplot to directory**

``` r
ggsave("p8105_hw1_msp2210_scatterplot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

## Problem 2

**Creating dataframe**

``` r
problem2_df =
  tibble(
    random_samp = rnorm(10),
    vec_logical = random_samp > 10,
    vec_char = c("wildebeest", "giraffe", "zebra", "elephant", "lion", "hippo", "warthog", "rhino", "ostrich", "flamingo"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("Level 1", "Level 2", "Level 3", "Level 2", "Level 3", "Level 3", "Level 2", "Level 1", "Level 2", "Level 3"))
)
```

**Taking means of variables**

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, random_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.1401788

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(problem2_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem2_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The random sample variable and the logical vector produce numeric
values, but the character and factor variables do not, they result in
“NA”. As they are not numeric, it is not possible to take the arithmetic
mean.

**Converting variables to numeric variables**

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(problem2_df, vec_factor))
```

Now that the variables have numeric values, it is possible to take the
mean. For the logical vector, the “TRUE” values become 1 and the “FALSE”
values become 0, which means that taking the mean of this vector will
give you an actual number (and this is what happened - even before using
the as.numeric() function, I was able to take the mean of the logical
vector). For the character vector, the as.numeric() function cannot
convert character strings into numeric values, so NAs are introduced by
coercion. For the factor vector, the as.numeric function converts the
factors into numbers based on the levels, which means it will now be
possible to take the mean. Initially, we were unable to find the mean of
these variables because they were not numeric variables.
