## Problem 1

**Loading libraries**

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──
    ## ✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5
    ## ✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.2
    ## ✔ ggplot2   4.0.0     ✔ tibble    3.3.0
    ## ✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1
    ## ✔ purrr     1.1.0     
    ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
    ## ℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors

``` r
library(moderndive)
```

**Loading the dataset**

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

This dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns. This dataset has 15 variables,
which are origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir,
wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour. The mean
temperature is 39.5821229 degrees Fahrenheit. The highest temperature
recorded was 57.92 degrees Fahrenheit and the lowest temperature
recorded was 24.08 degrees Fahrenheit.

**Creating a scatterplot**

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color=humid)) + geom_point()
```

Based on this plot, it is clear how temperature fluctuates throughout
the day. There is a zig-zag effect, because higher temperatures are
occurring during the day and then they decline at night (and this is a
cycle that continues throughout the month). The beginning of the month
has cooler temperatures during daytime and nighttime, and by January
14th, both of these temperatures have increased. Also, there was less
humidity at the beginning of the month when compared to the days leading
up to January 14th.

**Saving scatterplot to directory**

``` r
ggsave("p8105_hw1_msp2210_scatterplot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```
